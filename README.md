Suntales
Kindergarten Management App
A full-stack web application designed to support the daily operations of a kindergarten â€” from classroom activities to meal tracking, announcements, and parent communication.

ðŸ“Œ What the Project Does
This app provides a secure, role-based platform for managing a kindergartenâ€™s daily life. It includes:

Admin Dashboard: Manage users, assign roles (Parent/Teacher), create announcements,
events, weekly menus, invoices, and classroom activities.

Parent Portal: View your childâ€™s student card with access to parent and teacher contact info, 
track meals, update medical info, and stay informed about classroom activities and announcements.

Teacher Tools: Track meals for students, upload and manage classroom activities, and 
view student cards with access to parent and teacher contact info.

ðŸ’¡ Why It's Useful
This project streamlines communication between staff and families, centralizes student data, 
and brings joyful transparency to everyday kindergarten life. 
Itâ€™s built to be intuitive, secure, and scalable â€” perfect for schools that want to digitize their workflow while keeping things playful and personal.
